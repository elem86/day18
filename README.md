🎯 Day 18 – One Project a Day Until I Get Hired

🧩 Interactive Superstore Dashboard with Streamlit

Today I built a lightweight web dashboard using Streamlit to explore sales data from the Superstore dataset in a more visual and interactive way — all in Python!

✅ What I accomplished:

  - 📂 Loaded and cleaned the dataset with pandas

  - 🧭 Built a dropdown selector to filter data by region

  - 💡 Calculated KPIs like total sales and total orders

  - 📈 Created a monthly sales trend chart using seaborn and matplotlib

  - 📅 Cleaned up date parsing for smooth display and correct groupings

🔍 The dashboard updates instantly when selecting a region, and it's simple enough to scale into a more robust BI tool.

📁 Dataset: Superstore (via Kaggle)
💻 Built with: Python, Streamlit, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

💭 Streamlit is honestly one of the quickest ways to turn a CSV into something impressive — and interactive — in under an hour.
